# Changelog

All notable changes to PACR will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- **Friends activity feed redesigned to match Stitch mockup**: Activity cards now use a vertical layout with prominent uppercase title, stat grid with green accent values in glass-effect boxes, squared avatars, relative timestamps ("2H AGO // RUNNING"), and date/time display. Map tile from CARTO dark basemap shown as subtle full-card background when GPS coordinates are available. Backend `FriendActivityDto` extended with `startLatitude`/`startLongitude` fields. New i18n keys for stat labels (distance, duration, pace, BPM, elevation, calories) in EN and DE.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Running Buddy "Matches" tab is now the primary entry point.** The Buddy hub opens on a new **Matches** tab (replacing "Discover" as the default) that proactively suggests other runners matching the user's own buddy preferences — pace tolerance from `User.paceRefTimeSeconds`/`paceRefDistanceM`, search radius via `User.latitude`/`longitude` haversine, and a weekday-availability overlap between both parties' `UserBuddyPreferences`. Each match card shows avatar, city, distance, the buddy's typical pace, a pace-match score bar and a "Propose run" CTA — clicking it deep-links to `/buddy/new?inviteUserId=…&inviteName=…`, which pre-selects `PRIVATE_INVITE` visibility and after creating the run automatically sends the invitation via the existing `POST /api/buddy-runs/{id}/invite` endpoint (so the recipient gets the in-app + email invite immediately). Users who have not opted in see a CTA card pointing to `/buddy/preferences`; an empty-state hint nudges users to widen radius or pace tolerance. Backend: new endpoint `GET /api/buddy-runs/matches` returning `{ optedIn, matches[] }`; new `BuddyMatchService.suggestBuddiesForUser(me, prefs)` and helpers `computeBuddyPaceScore` + `availabilityOverlap`. Frontend: extended `BuddyRunService.matches()`, new `BuddyMatchesResponse` interface, reworked `buddy.html`/`buddy.scss` with the match grid and score bar, and `BuddyCreate` reads query params + chains the invite call. New i18n keys `BUDDY.TAB_MATCHES`, `MATCH_SCORE`, `MATCHES_HINT/EMPTY/OPTIN_*`, `OPEN_PREFERENCES`, `PROPOSE_RUN`, `PROPOSE_TO` in EN and DE.

- **Buddy Run creation now has a map picker for the meeting point.** Reusing the existing `LocationPickerDialogComponent` (Leaflet), users can pick the meeting location on a map instead of typing their home address. A new map button next to the meeting-point input opens the picker, and reverse-geocoding via Nominatim auto-suggests a public name (e.g. "Stadtpark, Frankfurt") when the field is still empty, after either map pick or current-location use.

- **Running Buddy feature: users can arrange peer-to-peer running dates with friends or opt-in strangers (v0.49.0).** New navigation entry "Running Buddy" under the Community menu and a top-level "Notifications" entry with an unread-count badge. The feature covers three flows: posting an open buddy run that friends or nearby runners can join (`FRIENDS_ONLY` / `PUBLIC_NEARBY` / `PRIVATE_INVITE` visibility), sending a direct 1:1 invite to a specific user, and an auto-match panel on the run detail page that ranks opt-in candidates by pace tolerance, geographic distance, weekday/time-range availability and friendship status. Each run has a meeting point with optional lat/lon (current-location button), distance, expected duration, target pace range and max participant cap. The new in-app notification system delivers `BUDDY_INVITE`, `BUDDY_JOIN`, `BUDDY_WITHDRAW`, `BUDDY_CANCELLED`, and `BUDDY_REMINDER_24H` / `BUDDY_REMINDER_1H` events; a scheduler running every 5 minutes sends both an in-app notification and an email (reusing `EmailService`) when a buddy run is 24h or 1h away. Backend: Liquibase migrations `135-add-buddy-runs.xml` (tables `buddy_runs` + `buddy_run_participants` with CASCADE delete), `136-add-user-buddy-preferences.xml` (`buddy_discoverable`, `search_radius_km`, `pace_tolerance_percent`, `available_weekdays`, `available_time_ranges`, `auto_match_enabled`), `137-add-user-notifications.xml` (generic `user_notifications` with type enum + `reference_id`). New entities `BuddyRun`, `BuddyRunParticipant`, `UserBuddyPreferences`, `UserNotification`; services `BuddyRunService` (create/join/invite/respond/withdraw/cancel, friendship-aware visibility check via `FriendshipRepository.areAcceptedFriends`, haversine geo filter), `BuddyMatchService` (pace score from `User.paceRefTimeSeconds`/`paceRefDistanceM`, weekday/time availability check), `NotificationService` (generic persist/markRead/unreadCount), `BuddyReminderScheduler` (`@Scheduled(cron = "0 */5 * * * ?")`). REST endpoints under `/api/buddy-runs` (POST, GET /open, /upcoming, /mine, /{id}, POST /{id}/join, /withdraw, /invite, /respond, /cancel, GET /{id}/suggested-buddies), `/api/users/me/buddy-preferences` (GET/PUT), `/api/notifications` (list, /unread-count, POST /{id}/read, /read-all). `EmailService` gained `sendBuddyReminder` and `sendBuddyInvite` methods. Frontend: new standalone components under `frontend/src/app/components/buddy/`, `buddy-create/`, `buddy-detail/`, `buddy-preferences/`, `notifications/` with KINETIC-style cards, tabs (Discover / Upcoming / Mine), suggestion list with avatar + pace + distance chips, and toggle-switch preferences page (radius slider, pace tolerance slider, weekday chips, time-range input). New services `BuddyRunService` and `NotificationService` (60s polling signal `unreadCount`) wired into the sidebar so the bell badge updates without page reload. New routes `/buddy`, `/buddy/new`, `/buddy/:id`, `/buddy/preferences`, `/notifications`. New i18n sections `BUDDY.*` and `NOTIFICATIONS.*` plus `COMMON.SAVED` in EN and DE.

- **Dashboard now shows a short-term run-weather forecast based on the user's home address.** A new section at the top of the dashboard summarises the next ~12 hours of weather as a single GOOD / CAUTION / BAD verdict along with human-readable reasons (rain likely at 17:00, thunderstorm risk, strong wind, heat warning, freezing temperatures, …) and a stat row with current temperature, max rain probability, total precipitation and max wind. Powered by the DWD ICON-D2 model (served via Open-Meteo); responses are cached per ~1 km coordinate bucket for 30 minutes. Settings got a new "Home address" section with street, postal code, city and country (ISO 2) — when the address changes the backend forward-geocodes it through Nominatim to update the user's stored coordinates, so the existing map-picker location stays in sync. Backend: Liquibase migration `134-add-user-address-fields.xml` adds `address_street`, `address_postal_code`, `address_city`, `address_country` columns to `users`; new `RunWeatherForecastService` + `RunWeatherForecastDto` + `RunWeatherForecastController` expose `GET /api/weather/forecast` (returns 204 No Content when the user has no location); `ForwardGeocodingService.geocode(query, countryCode)` overload added so non-DE addresses can resolve; `UserService.updateUser` accepts the four new fields and auto-geocodes on change. Frontend: new `WeatherService`, dashboard widget with verdict badge and reason list, and a Settings form for the address. New i18n keys under `DASHBOARD.WEATHER_*`, `WEATHER.REASON_*`, and `SETTINGS.ADDRESS_*` in EN and DE.

### Fixed
- **Run Club logo/cover upload no longer fails with `MaxUploadSizeExceededException`.** The global multipart limit in `application.properties` was 5 MB, which is below the size of typical smartphone photos (8–12 MB JPEG). Raised `spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size` and `max-request-size` to 20 MB so club admins can upload original-resolution logos and cover images. A handler for `MaxUploadSizeExceededException` in `GlobalExceptionHandler` already returns a clean HTTP 413 when the new limit is exceeded.

### Added
- **Run Club admins can now create events directly from the Run Club detail view.** The Events tab was previously read-only — the existing list endpoint expected published events linked to a club via `group_events.run_club_id`, but no UI or backend endpoint allowed a club admin to create or link such an event (the only create path was `POST /api/trainer/events`, gated by the global `TRAINER`/`ADMIN` system role). New backend endpoints on `RunClubController` — `POST /api/run-clubs/{id}/events`, `PUT /{id}/events/{eventId}`, `PUT /{id}/events/{eventId}/publish`, `PUT /{id}/events/{eventId}/cancel`, `DELETE /{id}/events/{eventId}`, `GET /{id}/events/{eventId}` — authorize via `RunClubService.requireClubAdmin` (now also public, with a `(Long, User)` overload) and verify event-to-club ownership through `GroupEventService.requireClubEvent`. `GroupEventService` got a new `createClubEvent(User, RunClub, CreateGroupEventRequest)` that bypasses the trainer-only check and links the event to the club, plus club-scoped `update/publish/cancel/delete/getAllClubEvents` variants; the mapping code from `createEvent` was extracted into a private `buildEventFromRequest` helper. `GET /api/run-clubs/{id}/events` now also returns `DRAFT` events for club admins so they can manage them from the tab. Frontend: new lazy routes `/run-clubs/:slug/events/new` and `/run-clubs/:slug/events/:id/edit` reuse the existing `TrainerEventForm`, which became club-context-aware — when a `:slug` is present it loads the club, swaps its create/update/publish/load calls to `RunClubService`, redirects back to `/run-clubs/:slug` after save, and skips image upload (no club image endpoint yet). `RunClubService` gained `createEvent`, `updateEvent`, `publishEvent`, `cancelEvent`, `deleteEvent`, `getEvent` methods, and `getEvents` is now strongly typed (`GroupEventDto[]`). The Events tab in `run-club-detail.html` shows a "Create event" button and an admin-only empty-state hint for admins (`canManage` / `myRole === 'ADMIN'`), renders a "Draft" badge for unpublished events and links admins to the edit route instead of the public event detail. New i18n keys `RUN_CLUBS.CREATE_EVENT` / `NO_EVENTS_ADMIN_HINT` / `EVENT_DRAFT` in EN and DE.

- **Run Club posts and events now appear in the News Hub for active members.** Posts from every Run Club where the current user holds an `ACTIVE` membership are mixed into the main News Hub feed as a new entry type (visible in the "All" and "Social" tabs), and upcoming club-linked `GroupEvent`s show up in the right-hand "Trainer Events" sidebar alongside trainer events. Run-Club cards are fully interactive: like and comment work directly from the hub, reusing the existing `run_club_post_likes` / `run_club_post_comments` tables — so a like placed in the hub also shows up on the club detail page. Backend: new aggregated `RunClubPostRepository.findFeedForUser` query (filters by `RunClubMembershipStatus.ACTIVE` via a subquery on `RunClubMembership`), new `GroupEventRepository.findUpcomingForMember` / `findRecurringForMemberInRange` queries (one-off + recurring series expansion), new service methods `RunClubFeedService.listFeedForUser` and `GroupEventService.getUpcomingClubEventsForMember`, and two new endpoints on `RunClubController` — `GET /api/run-clubs/feed?page&size` returning a Spring `Page<RunClubPostDto>` (DTO extended with `clubName`/`clubSlug`/`clubLogoFilename`) and `GET /api/run-clubs/feed/upcoming-events` returning `List<GroupEventDto>`. `GroupEventDto` gained `runClubId`/`runClubName`/`runClubSlug` fields so the sidebar can tag club events with a "Club" chip. Frontend: `RunClubService` gained `getNewsHubFeed` / `getNewsHubClubEvents`, `RunClubFeedPost` extends `RunClubPost` with the club identity fields, and `NewsHub` integrates them — the `FeedEntry` union now has a third variant `runclub`, the trainer-events rail merges in club events without duplicates, and a new `.card--runclub` template renders the club logo header, post content, optional first image, like button (optimistic update with rollback) and inline expandable comments mirroring the news-card UX. New i18n keys `NEWS_HUB.RUNCLUB.{CLUB_CHIP,POSTED_BY}` in EN and DE.

### Fixed
- **Run Club feed composer was hidden for active members.** `RunClubDetailDto` declared `isMember` with a `setMember(...)` setter, so Jackson serialized the property as JSON key `"member"` rather than `"isMember"`. The frontend (`run-club.model.ts`) reads `isMember`, so `canPost()` always evaluated to false and the composer never rendered. Added `@JsonProperty("isMember")` on the field, getter and setter.

### Added
- **Run Club posts now support multiple image attachments.** New `run_club_post_images` table (Liquibase migration `133-add-run-club-post-images.xml`) and `RunClubPostImage` entity hold an unbounded, ordered list of images per post (cascade-delete with the post). The `POST /api/run-clubs/{id}/posts` endpoint switched to `multipart/form-data` (`data` JSON part + repeated `images` parts), and a new `GET /api/run-clubs/posts/{postId}/images/{imageId}` endpoint serves them. The composer in the Run Club detail Feed tab gained an "Add images" button with thumbnail previews and per-image remove. Feed posts render images as a CSS-grid gallery with a click-through lightbox (prev/next/close). New i18n keys `RUN_CLUBS.ADD_IMAGES` / `REMOVE_IMAGE` (EN+DE).

### Fixed
- **Run Clubs map markers no longer render at the logo's natural size.** Clubs with an uploaded logo previously rendered the image as a giant overlay on the `/run-clubs` map because the `.rc-marker` styles were defined inside `run-clubs.scss` using a `:global(.rc-marker)` selector — `:global()` is not valid Angular SCSS syntax, so the rules either weren't applied or were trapped behind component view-encapsulation attributes that the Leaflet `divIcon` DOM (rendered outside the component subtree in `.leaflet-marker-pane`) never carries. Moved the styles to global `frontend/src/styles.scss` so they reliably hit the Leaflet-injected DOM, and added `display: block` on the inner `<img>` to remove the inline baseline gap.

### Added
- **Run Clubs — full community feature under Community.** Run clubs are persistent communities (vs. one-off `GroupEvents`) that members join to run together. Users can apply to found a club; a PACR admin approves it. Each club has a profile (logo + cover image, city, lat/lng, meeting point, free-text schedule and a `Set<DayOfWeek>` for filtering, social links, optional verified-badge), a member list with `ADMIN`/`MEMBER` roles (last-admin protection), a per-club `OPEN` / `REQUEST` join policy, an internal feed (posts + likes + comments, posts can link to an Activity, CommunityRoute or GroupEvent), optional verified GroupEvents linked via the new `group_events.run_club_id` FK, and aggregated stats (member count, lifetime + last-30d kilometers across all active members, total event km). Discovery surfaces are a Leaflet map and a filterable list (by city / weekday / search). New backend layer: Liquibase migrations `128-add-run-clubs.xml` (`run_clubs` + `run_club_meeting_days` + `run_club_memberships` with composite uniqueness and lat/lng/city/status indexes), `129-add-run-club-feed.xml` (`run_club_posts` + `run_club_post_likes` + `run_club_post_comments` with soft-delete), `130-add-group-event-run-club-fk.xml`, `131-add-user-run-clubs-enabled.xml` (per-user feature flag, default true). Entities `RunClub`, `RunClubMembership`, `RunClubPost`, `RunClubPostLike`, `RunClubPostComment` plus enums `RunClubStatus`, `RunClubJoinPolicy`, `RunClubMemberRole`, `RunClubMembershipStatus`. Services `RunClubService` (CRUD, slug generation with umlaut-aware truncation + numeric conflict suffix, approval flow, image upload via the existing `ImageStoragePort`), `RunClubMembershipService` (join/leave/approve/reject/promote/demote/kick with last-admin protection), `RunClubFeedService` (member-only visibility, max-one linked entity validation, soft-delete), `RunClubStatsService` (JPQL aggregation over `CompletedTraining`). Controllers `RunClubController` (`/api/run-clubs`) and `RunClubAdminController` (`/api/admin/run-clubs`, `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`). 25 service tests cover the approval flow, slug uniqueness, OPEN/REQUEST join policies, last-admin protection, kick authorization, post visibility, linked-entity validation and soft-delete. `UserDeletionService` extended for DSGVO: posts/comments author → NULL, likes hard-deleted, memberships dropped. New frontend area: standalone components `RunClubs` (overview with list/map tabs, filter chips, FAB), `RunClubDetail` (hero with cover/logo, four mat-tabs Übersicht/Feed/Mitglieder/Events, admin three-dot menu, mini map), `RunClubForm` (reactive form with `LocationPickerDialogComponent`, day-toggles, join-policy radio cards, logo + cover upload), `RunClubFeedPost`, `RunClubPostComposer`, and `AdminRunClubs` (Pending/Approved/Rejected tabs with reason-modal reject and verify-toggle). Routes `/run-clubs`, `/run-clubs/new`, `/run-clubs/:slug`, `/run-clubs/:slug/edit`, plus admin route `/admin/run-clubs`. Sidebar entry under the existing Community submenu, gated by `runClubsEnabled`. New settings toggle `SETTINGS.RUN_CLUBS_TOGGLE` posting to dedicated `PATCH /api/run-clubs/me/enabled`. Full `RUN_CLUBS.*` and `ADMIN.*` i18n namespaces in EN and DE, plus `NAV.RUN_CLUBS` and `ADMIN.TAB_RUN_CLUBS`.

### Fixed
- **Recurring group event registrations are now occurrence-specific.** Previously clicking a single recurring occurrence card on `/community/groups` and registering on the detail page created a registration with `occurrence_date = NULL`, effectively registering the user for the entire RRULE series — and per-occurrence participant counts on every other card stayed at 0 because the count query is occurrence-scoped. Cards now pass the `occurrenceDate` of the rendered occurrence as a query param when navigating to the detail page; the detail component reads it on init, hands it to `getEventDetail`, and forwards it to `register` / `cancelRegistration`. Backend `GET /api/group-events/{id}` accepts an optional `occurrenceDate` query param and routes through `getEventOccurrenceDetail` when provided. `GroupEventService.registerForEvent` now rejects recurring events when no occurrence date is supplied (`Occurrence date is required when registering for a recurring event`) so the inconsistent state cannot be re-introduced through the API.

### Added
- **Group event cards now show participant avatars.** Cards on `/community/groups` (Near / Upcoming / Mine tabs) display up to 5 overlapping circular avatars of registered participants in the card footer, with a `+N` overflow badge when more users are registered. For recurring events the preview is occurrence-aware and reuses the same counting logic as `currentParticipants`. Backend: new DTO `GroupEventParticipantPreviewDto` (`userId`, `username`, `profileImageFilename`); `GroupEventDto` extended with `participantPreview` field; `GroupEventService.toDto` fetches the first 5 registrations via new `Pageable` overloads on `GroupEventRegistrationRepository.findByEventIdAndStatus` / `findByEventIdAndOccurrenceDateAndStatus`. Frontend: `GroupEvents` component lazily fetches per-user profile images via the existing `GET /api/users/{id}/profile-image` endpoint and caches them as object URLs (revoked in `ngOnDestroy`); falls back to initials when no profile image exists.

### Changed
- **Bot runners can now do multiple laps on short routes.** Previously `BotRunnerService.pickRoute()` filtered community routes strictly by the bot's `[distanceMinKm, distanceMaxKm]` window, so a 6–8 km bot would skip every 2 km route in its radius and end up with `NO_ROUTE`. The picker now also accepts shorter routes if they can be looped 2–`MAX_LAPS_PER_RUN` (=4) times to fit into the bot's distance window. Lap count is drawn at random from the valid range (`ceil(min/routeKm)` to `min(floor(max/routeKm), 4)`), so realistic 3×2 km or 4×1.6 km outings are possible without the absurd-feeling 10-laps-on-the-same-loop case. The generated `CompletedTraining` carries `totalLaps`, the GPS / time / distance / HR streams are repeated and accumulate continuously across lap boundaries, elevation gain scales with laps, and the activity name gets a "(N Runden)" suffix. Multi-lap runs are excluded from the route leaderboard (their total distance does not match the route's nominal distance). (`BotRunnerService.java`)

### Added
- **Trainer events can now have a custom icon/image.** Trainers can upload a PNG/JPG/WebP image (max 5 MB) when creating or editing a group event in `/trainer/events/create|edit`. The image is shown as a thumbnail in the trainer event list, as a hero image on the trainer/community event detail pages, and as a header in the public group-events card grid. Storage reuses the existing `ImageStoragePort` filesystem adapter (UUID filenames); old files are deleted on replace/remove. New backend column `group_events.event_image_filename` (Liquibase migration `126-add-group-event-image.xml`), new endpoints `POST /api/trainer/events/{id}/image` (multipart), `DELETE /api/trainer/events/{id}/image`, and authenticated read endpoint `GET /api/group-events/{id}/image`. New frontend standalone component `app-event-image` encapsulates Blob fetching + ObjectURL lifecycle. New i18n keys `TRAINER_EVENTS.{SECTION_IMAGE,IMAGE_UPLOAD,IMAGE_REMOVE,IMAGE_HINT,IMAGE_INVALID_TYPE,IMAGE_TOO_LARGE,IMAGE_UPLOAD_ERROR}` in EN and DE.
- **Trainer events from nearby (25 km) now appear in the News Hub right sidebar.** All logged-in users — including non-PRO — now see published group/trainer events within 25 km of their browser location in a dedicated "Trainer Events nearby" side card on `/news-hub` (next 30 days, sorted ascending by date so the next ones are on top). Recurring events are expanded into individual occurrences and marked with a small `repeat` icon. The card was deliberately placed in the right rail rather than the main feed so it stands out instead of getting buried between news articles and friend activity. Clicking an entry navigates to `/community/groups/:id`, where the existing `@RequiresSubscription(PRO)` ProOverlay wall takes over for non-PRO users — the discovery surface is open, the deeper detail/registration stays gated. Backend: new public read-only endpoint `GET /api/news-feed/trainer-events?lat=&lon=&radiusKm=25&days=30` (`TrainerEventFeedController`) reuses `GroupEventService.getNearbyEvents` (haversine + recurring-event expansion) and filters to the [today, today+30 days] window. Frontend: `NewsHub` requests browser geolocation with a 4 s timeout (fallback Munich) and pulls events via `GroupEventService.getNearbyForFeed`. New i18n keys `NEWS_HUB.TRAINER_EVENT.{BADGE,BY,VIEW_DETAILS,SIDE_TITLE,EMPTY,RECURRING}` in EN and DE.
- **LADV import for road-running events.** New admin area at `/admin/ladv` lets admins configure one LADV PUBLIC API source per Landesverband (BY, WUE, HE, …) and pull running events (Strassenlauf / Volkslauf / Berglauf / Crosslauf) from the LADV `/stadionfern` endpoint. Pulled events land in a staging table (`ladv_staged_event`); admins review them and adopt each one as a PACR `Competition` with one click. Adopted events are flagged `systemGenerated=true`, get coordinates via Nominatim forward-geocoding, and have their `laufstrecken[]` mapped to `CompetitionFormat`s with sensible distance buckets (5K/10K/HM/Marathon, etc.). Re-fetching the same source dedupes via the unique `(source_id, ladv_id)` constraint. The LADV API key is supplied through the `LADV_API_KEY` env var (a key with Landesverbandsdaten access is required — without it the `/stadionfern` endpoint returns HTTP 401 and the UI surfaces an explicit message). New backend layer: migration `125-create-ladv-import-tables.xml`, entities `LadvImportSource` + `LadvStagedEvent`, services `LadvApiClient` / `LadvImporterService` / `LadvCompetitionAdoptionService` / `ForwardGeocodingService`, REST controller `AdminLadvController` under `/api/admin/ladv`. New frontend area: `LadvImportPage` + `LadvSourceForm` standalone components, `AdminLadvService`, route `admin/ladv`, admin-shell tab `directions_run`, and a full set of `ADMIN.LADV_*` i18n keys in EN and DE. Audit-log actions `LADV_EVENT_ADOPTED` / `LADV_EVENT_IGNORED` track every per-event decision.

### Fixed
- **Activity detail: performance bento now collapses correctly on mobile.** The Performance Analytics Hub (`STRAIN`, `RAW_LOAD`, `TRIMP`, `VO2_MAX`, `AEROBIC_DECOUPLING`, `EFFICIENCY_FACTOR`) was rendering four cramped columns on phones, causing values like `16.4` and `VO2_MAX` to get clipped or wrap one letter per line. Cause: in `activity-detail.scss` the responsive `@include respond-to($bp-lg)` and `@media (max-width: 600px)` blocks were declared *before* the base `.perf-bento { grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); }` and `.bento-card--strain { grid-column: span 2; grid-row: span 2; }` rules, so source-order specificity made the desktop layout always win. Both responsive blocks were moved to the end of the file. Mobile (≤600 px) now shows a single column and tablets (≤900 px) two columns as intended. (`activity-detail.scss`)
- **Strava sync no longer aborts when duplicate daily body_metrics exist.** `MetricsKernelService.upsertDaily` previously crashed with `NonUniqueResultException` whenever the `body_metrics` table contained two or more rows for the same `(user_id, metric_type, recorded_at)` combination with `source_activity_id IS NULL` — which broke the entire Strava activity sync (`StravaService.syncActivitiesForUser` -> `MetricsKernelService.computeForDateRange`). New Liquibase migration `127-cleanup-body-metrics-duplicates.xml` (1) deletes the older duplicate rows keeping the newest id per group, (2) adds a stored generated column `source_activity_id_norm = COALESCE(source_activity_id, 0)` so MariaDB can treat NULL deterministically, and (3) creates a unique index `ux_body_metrics_daily (user_id, metric_type, recorded_at, source_activity_id_norm)` to prevent the situation from recurring. The repository method now returns a list ordered by id desc, and `upsertDaily` defensively keeps the newest row while pruning any leftover duplicates with a warn-level log.
- **Community Routes: mobile layout fixed.** On `/community-routes` the route grid was rendering two cramped columns on phones because the `respond-to($bp)` mixin (`max-width` query) had been applied inversely — desktop was getting one column and mobile two. The defaults are now desktop-first (2 columns for the route grid, 3 columns for the filter bar, row layout for the page header) and the mobile breakpoint collapses each to a single column / vertical stack. The page header padding was tightened on mobile so the "My Routes" button no longer overflows. (`community-routes.scss`)
- **"In deiner Nähe" toggle is now actually functional.** The switch in the `/community-routes` header was hardcoded `active` and had no click handler. It now toggles a `nearYouEnabled` signal: when off, the request bypasses the radius dropdown by sending a 20 000 km radius so all routes load. The track gets `flex-shrink: 0`, `box-sizing: border-box` and an explicit `display` to stop mobile UA styles from deforming the thumb. `.header-actions` is `flex-wrap: nowrap` so the "Meine Routen" button and the toggle stay on the same row; the button is allowed to wrap its label and uses tighter padding/letter-spacing on mobile. (`community-routes.ts`, `community-routes.html`, `community-routes.scss`)

### Removed
- **Signup page: "Or sync with" section and "Already have an account?" header text removed.** The non-functional Garmin/Strava/Google sync buttons (with the "Or sync with" / "Oder synchronisieren mit" divider) below the registration form were stripped, since the integrations are not implemented. The redundant "Already have an account?" / "Bereits ein Konto?" label next to the header `Log in` button was also removed to reduce header crowding. Unused `.divider`, `.social-grid`, `.social-btn`, `.already-text` styles and the i18n keys `SIGNUP.OR_SYNC` and `SIGNUP.ALREADY_ACCOUNT` were cleaned up in EN and DE.

### Changed
- **Dashboard readiness hero is more compact and the decorative GO button is gone.** The readiness score card at the top of `/dashboard` previously dominated the viewport with an oversized score and a non-interactive "GO" pill on the right. Padding shrunk from `40px 48px` to `20px 24px`, the score font size from `clamp(4rem, 9vw, 5.5rem)` to `clamp(2.8rem, 6vw, 3.6rem)`, and surrounding gaps/margins were tightened so the recommendation, reasons and color-coded background stay readable but take roughly half the vertical space. (`dashboard.html`, `dashboard.scss`)

### Removed
- **"Last Run" card removed from dashboard.** The standalone `last-run-card` block (Strain21, drift %, Z4/Z5 minutes, coach bullets) was redundant with the activity feed and strain trend chart. The card markup, the `hasLastRun()` helper, all `.last-run-card`/`.run-metric`/`.coach-bullets` styles, and the orphaned i18n keys `DASHBOARD.LAST_RUN` and `DASHBOARD.DRIFT` were removed. (`dashboard.html`, `dashboard.ts`, `dashboard.scss`, `en.json`, `de.json`)

### Fixed
- **Featured activity map no longer leaves a blank strip on mobile.** On `/activities` the featured ("LATEST") card switches from a 33%-wide map (desktop) to a full-width map below `$bp-lg` (900px). Leaflet had cached the original container width and rendered tiles only for that area, leaving an empty strip on the right of the card on phones. `ActivityMapComponent` now attaches a `ResizeObserver` to its map container and calls `map.invalidateSize()` (rAF-debounced) on every size change, plus a one-shot `invalidateSize()`/`fitBounds()` after the initial route is drawn to handle layouts that stabilise after the map mounts. (`activity-map.ts`)
- **Competitions list cards no longer overflow on mobile.** On `/competitions` the race grid used `minmax(400px, 1fr)`, which exceeded the viewport on phones (~375px) and clipped the cards horizontally. Below `$bp-sm` (640px) the grid now collapses to a single column, page padding shrinks to `1.5rem 1rem`, the page header stacks vertically, and the race-card inner padding is reduced to `1rem`. Desktop layout unchanged. (`competitions.scss`)

### Added
- **Mobile bottom navigation bar.** On viewports below 768px (mobile browsers and the iOS Capacitor app), primary navigation is now exposed via a fixed bottom tab bar with five tabs (Dashboard, Activities, Training Plans, News Hub, More). The "More" tab opens the full sidebar as an overlay drawer for everything secondary. The previous mobile hamburger button was removed. The bar respects the iOS home-indicator safe area (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`) and the active tab is highlighted in the brand green. Desktop and tablet layouts are unchanged. New i18n key `NAV.MORE` in EN and DE. New standalone component `frontend/src/app/components/bottom-nav/`.
- **Training-plans view shows completed runs below planned trainings per day.** On `/training-plan` each uploaded `Run` or `VirtualRun` activity now renders as its own card directly under the planned training of the same day. The card shows the activity name, an "Absolviert" chip and the actual metrics (distance, moving time, pace, avg HR, elevation gain) in a green accent line and links to the activity detail on click. Walks and other sports are filtered out. `loadWeek()` extends its `forkJoin` with `ActivityService.getByDateRange()`. New i18n keys `TRAINING_PLAN.UNPLANNED`, `UNPLANNED_ACTIVITY`, `COMPLETED_ACTIVITY` in EN and DE.
- **Dashboard popup for new Strava activities after login.** When a user logs in, the backend asynchronously triggers a Strava sync over the last 7 days and the dashboard checks for the most recent Strava activity uploaded since the previous login (`User.previousLoginAt`, populated on every login from the prior `lastLoginAt`). If one is found, it is shown in a native `<dialog>` popup with sport icon, name, date, distance, moving time and avg/max HR, plus a "View details" CTA that routes to `/activities/:id`. New endpoint `GET /api/dashboard/new-strava-activity` (returns 204 when nothing is new). New `NewStravaActivityDto`, repository method `findTopByUserIdAndSourceAndUploadDateAfterOrderByUploadDateDesc`, Liquibase migration `124-add-user-previous-login-at.xml`. `StravaService.syncActivitiesForUser(User, ...)` extracted so the login background sync can run without a SecurityContext. New i18n keys under `NEW_STRAVA_DIALOG.*` in EN and DE.
- **Self-assessment for completed activities.** Users can now rate every uploaded activity from the activity detail page (`/activities/:id`). A new "Self-Assessment" section captures how they felt (5-point smiley scale), perceived exertion (RPE 1–10), training quality (5-star rating) and a free-text note (max 1000 chars). Values are persisted on `CompletedTraining` and saved via the new `PUT /api/completed-trainings/{id}/feedback` endpoint (ownership-checked via `findByIdAndUserId`), with validation via the new `ActivityFeedbackDto` (`@Min/@Max/@Size`). Existing feedback is loaded on open. Liquibase migration `123-add-activity-feedback.xml` adds the four nullable columns (`rpe`, `feeling`, `training_quality`, `feedback_note`) to `completed_trainings`. Reuses the existing `SELF_ASSESSMENT.*` i18n keys in EN and DE.

### Fixed
- **Strava OAuth callback no longer returns 500 in production.** Previously the callback `GET /api/strava/callback?code=...` failed with "An unexpected error occurred" because Strava redirects the browser without the JWT Authorization header, so `securityUtils.getCurrentUser()` returned null and the token exchange aborted. The authorize URL generated by `GET /api/strava/auth-url` now carries an `&state=<uuid>` parameter; the backend keeps a short-lived (10 min) in-memory mapping `state → userId` and resolves the user from `state` in the callback instead of the SecurityContext. This also closes the CSRF hole (OAuth best practice — the `state` parameter was previously empty). Errors during the callback now redirect to `/overview?strava=error&reason=…` instead of surfacing as an opaque 500.

### Changed
- **Page hero headlines now display on a single line.** The two-tone main headline (white word + green accent word) on Activities, AI Trainer, Asthma Tracking, Body Metrics, Cycle Tracking, Community Routes, Competitions, Group Events, My Routes, News Hub, Settings, Statistics, Trainer Events and Training Plan no longer wraps the accent word onto its own line. The `<br/>` between the two words was replaced with a single space so the heading takes up less vertical space in the hero block. The green accent color (`var(--pp)`) is unchanged.
- **Dashboard VO2max is now a smoothed long-term value.** Instead of showing the raw per-workout Daniels/HR-corrected estimate (which fluctuates 1–3 points depending on heat, GPS drift and workout type), the VO2max gauge now reflects a per-user EWMA (τ=18 days) over eligible running workouts with outlier clipping (±3.0 ml/kg/min) and display hysteresis (0.5-point threshold) to prevent the integer value from oscillating on minor internal changes. A new append-only `user_vo2max_state` table persists every state transition for audit/history purposes. Per-workout raw VO2max `BodyMetric` rows continue to be written for the existing history chart. New `Vo2MaxAggregationService` orchestrates eligibility filtering (quality_ok + ≥15 min duration + ≥80% HR coverage + at least one of pace-based / HR-corrected estimate), cold-start (first 3 eligible workouts use plain incremental mean), and the EWMA update. `completed_trainings` gained two nullable columns `quality_ok` and `hr_coverage_percent`, populated during FIT/GPX/TCX parsing (Liquibase migration `120-add-vo2max-quality-fields.xml`). State history table created via `121-add-user-vo2max-state.xml`. All thresholds are configurable via `vo2max.*` properties. New admin/user endpoints `GET /api/vo2max/state/current` and `GET /api/vo2max/state/history`. Dashboard card now displays the integer value with the `SMOOTHED` tag instead of `HR-corrected` (i18n keys `DASHBOARD.SMOOTHED` in EN and DE). Unit tests cover cold-start, outlier clipping, EWMA weighting, hysteresis and the minDeltaDays floor.

### Added
- **Admin: pick preview image for a competition.** The competition create/edit form (`/admin/competitions/new`, `/admin/competitions/:id/edit`) now shows the generated preview image with previous/next buttons so admins can rotate through the available images for the selected format category (marathon / city / ultra) and save the chosen index on the competition. A "Use default" button resets to the deterministic default. Backend: new nullable `image_index INT` column on `competitions` (Liquibase migration `119-competition-image-index.xml`), `Competition` entity extended, `CompetitionService.save` merges the field on update. Frontend: shared helper `competition-images.ts` (category mapping, image counts, `resolveImage`) used both in the user-facing list and the admin form. Missing `ultra-3.webp` placeholder added for a consistent count of 3 images per category. New i18n keys `ADMIN.COMP_IMAGE_SECTION`, `COMP_IMAGE_PREV`, `COMP_IMAGE_NEXT`, `COMP_IMAGE_RESET`, `COMP_IMAGE_HINT` in EN and DE.
- **Competitions: organizer website URL.** A competition can now store an optional link to the organizer's website. Admins can set the URL in the competition create/edit form (`/admin/competitions/new`, `/admin/competitions/:id/edit`), users see it as a clickable link in the competition info dialog on `/competitions`. Backend: new nullable `organizer_url VARCHAR(500)` column on `competitions` (Liquibase migration `118-competition-organizer-url.xml`), `Competition` entity + `CompetitionDto` extended, `CompetitionService.save` merges the field on update. New i18n keys `ADMIN.ORGANIZER_URL`, `ADMIN.ORGANIZER_URL_PLACEHOLDER`, `COMPETITIONS.ORGANIZER_WEBSITE` in EN and DE.
- **Admin: manage user competition registrations.** A new admin tab `/admin/registrations` lists every `CompetitionRegistration` (user, competition, assigned training plan, format, registered-at) with search across user email/name, competition and plan. Admins can delete a single user's registration (cascading removal of the user's `UserTrainingEntry` rows and their `PlanAdjustment` rows) or delete an entire competition globally (cascading removal of ALL registrations and their training entries). Global training plan templates remain untouched. This replaces the previous need to edit the database manually to support users. Backend: new `AdminRegistrationController` (`GET /api/admin/registrations`, `DELETE /api/admin/registrations/{id}`) and `AdminCompetitionController` (`DELETE /api/admin/competitions/{id}`), both `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`. `CompetitionService.unregister` was refactored to share its cascade logic with the new `deleteRegistrationById` admin path, and a join-fetch query `findAllForAdmin` was added to `CompetitionRegistrationRepository` to avoid N+1. New `AdminRegistrationDto` exposes user, competition, plan and format details. New i18n keys under `ADMIN.REGISTRATIONS.*` and `ADMIN.TAB_REGISTRATIONS` in EN and DE.
- **Competition formats: 20K, 30K and 40K added as competition format types.** The `CompetitionType` enum now includes the intermediate road-race distances `TWENTY_K` (20K), `THIRTY_K` (30K) and `FORTY_K` (40K), inserted in the type dropdown when creating/editing a competition (`/admin/competitions/new`, `/admin/competitions/:id/edit`) and shown correctly in the admin competition list and user-facing competition view. No DB migration required (`@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)`).
- **Admin Trainings view: export a complete training plan as JSON.** A new `Export Plan` button in the admin training list (`/admin/plans/:planId/trainings`) downloads the current state of the plan (name, description, targetTime, prerequisites, competitionType, plus all trainings grouped by `weekNumber`/`dayOfWeek` including their steps, step-blocks and prep-tips) as a pretty-printed JSON file in the v2.0 format consumed by `POST /api/training-plans/upload-template`. This enables moving locally-built plans into production by downloading + re-uploading. New admin-only endpoint `GET /api/admin/training-plans/{id}/export` (`@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`) sets `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="plan-{id}-{slug}.json"`. Implemented via new export DTOs under `com.trainingsplan.dto.export` and a new `TrainingPlanService.exportAsJson(Long)` method. New i18n keys `ADMIN.EXPORT_PLAN` / `ADMIN.EXPORT_PLAN_ERROR` in EN and DE.
- **Leave an active training plan from the Training Plans view.** Users can now exit any active plan directly from `/training-plans`. A new "Active Plans" section lists every plan the user is registered for (one entry per `CompetitionRegistration` with a training plan). Each entry has a "Leave Plan" button that opens a confirmation dialog explaining the consequences. On confirmation, the existing `DELETE /api/competitions/{id}/register` endpoint is called. The backend `CompetitionService.unregister` was extended to be transactional and to also delete all `UserTrainingEntry` rows linked to the registration plus their `PlanAdjustment` rows before removing the `CompetitionRegistration`. Competition and training plan templates as well as uploaded `CompletedTraining` (FIT) records are preserved. New `AuditAction.COMPETITION_UNREGISTERED` is recorded. New i18n keys under `TRAINING_PLAN.ACTIVE_PLANS`, `LEAVE_PLAN`, `LEAVE_PLAN_CONFIRM_TITLE`, `LEAVE_PLAN_CONFIRM_BODY`, `LEAVE_PLAN_CONFIRM` in EN and DE.

### Fixed
- **Login message form: Save/Cancel buttons still covered the user search dropdown — fixed for good by dropping `position: absolute`.** Three previous attempts (isolation, explicit `z-index: 500 vs 0`, `:has()` on the field) all failed in practice because the dropdown's stacking context and the form-actions' stacking context never reliably resolved to the same parent context across browsers. Real fix: stop floating the dropdown entirely. `.autocomplete-hint` and `.autocomplete-results` are now normal in-flow block elements inside the flex column `.autocomplete`. The dropdown simply pushes the Save/Cancel buttons down while visible — no overlap is physically possible. Removed all z-index gymnastics on `.form-actions`, `.field`, `.autocomplete`, `.autocomplete-hint`, `.autocomplete-results`. (`login-message-form.scss`)
- **Login message form: user search dropdown was covered by the Save/Cancel buttons.** The autocomplete results list on `/admin/login-messages/new` (when `targetType=USERS`) appeared behind the form action buttons. The first attempt (creating a stacking context on `.autocomplete` via `isolation: isolate`) did not help because the dropdown still had to compete in an outer stacking context that the siblings also occupied. Final fix: drop the isolation trick on `.autocomplete`, set the absolute-positioned dropdown/hint to `z-index: 500`, and explicitly place `.form-actions` at `position: relative; z-index: 0` so the two end up in the exact same stacking context with a clear ordering. Loading/no-results hint is now also absolute so it no longer pushes the buttons down while typing. (`login-message-form.scss`)

### Added
- **Admin users list: send login message shortcut.** Each row in `/admin/users` now has a mail icon button next to edit/delete that navigates to `/admin/login-messages/new?userId=…` and preselects the recipient (`targetType=USERS`, user appears as chip) — admins no longer need to search for the user in the login message form. New backend endpoint `GET /api/admin/users/{id}/summary` returns `{id, username, email}` for prefill. New i18n key `ADMIN.SEND_LOGIN_MESSAGE` (EN/DE).
- **Login messages: targeted audiences.** Admin login messages (`/admin/login-messages`) can now be targeted to a specific audience instead of always being shown to all users. The form offers three exclusive modes: `All users` (existing behavior, default), `User groups` (multi-select among `PRO`, `FREE`, `TRAINER` — driven by `User.subscriptionPlan` and `User.role`), and `Specific users` (autocomplete search by username/email with chip-based selection). Backend extends `LoginMessage` with `targetType`, `targetGroups` (`@ElementCollection`) and `targetUsers` (`@ManyToMany`); `LoginMessageService.findPendingForUser` filters published messages by the caller's group/user membership before checking the seen log. New admin endpoint `GET /api/admin/users/search?q=&limit=` powers the user autocomplete. Liquibase migration `117-login-message-targeting.xml` adds the `target_type` column (default `ALL`) and the join tables `login_message_target_groups` / `login_message_target_users`. New i18n keys under `ADMIN.LOGIN_MSG_TARGET_*` and `ADMIN.LOGIN_MSG_GROUP_*` in EN and DE.

### Changed
- **Achievement system: evaluation decoupled from achievement key.** The admin UI for achievements (`/admin/achievements`) was misleading: even though the form let admins freely pick a key, category and threshold, the backend evaluator (`AchievementEvaluationService`) selected what to measure for `PR` and `PLAN_COMPLETION` achievements via hardcoded `key.startsWith(...)` checks (`first_pr`, `pr_all_distances`, `pr_10_broken`, `week_100_pct`, `plan_completed`). Custom admin-created achievements with other keys silently never unlocked or behaved unexpectedly. A new explicit `AchievementMetric` enum now drives evaluation: `TOTAL_DISTANCE_KM`, `STREAK_DAYS`, `PR_TOTAL_COUNT`, `PR_DISTINCT_DISTANCES`, `PERFECT_WEEKS_COUNT`, `COMPLETED_PLANS_COUNT`. Each achievement carries its metric explicitly; the category (used for grouping/filter only) is auto-derived. The admin form replaces the category dropdown with a metric dropdown and shows the unit on the threshold field. `PERFECT_WEEKS_COUNT` and `COMPLETED_PLANS_COUNT` are now true counts (so admins can require e.g. "5 perfect weeks") instead of boolean flags. Liquibase migration `116-add-achievement-metric.xml` adds the `metric` column and backfills existing rows from `category` and `achievement_key`.
- **AchievementSeeder is now insert-only.** Previously the seeder rewrote name/description/icon/threshold/sortOrder for every default achievement on every startup, which silently reverted any admin edits to those fields. The seeder now only inserts achievements that don't yet exist in the database; admin edits via `/admin/achievements` are preserved across restarts.

### Fixed
- **News Hub: "Read article" button now opens a full-article modal.** Clicking any news card (hero, trending rail, or feed entry) or the `Read article` CTA now opens a modal dialog showing the hero image, topic tag, title, publication date, full article content (rendered as sanitized HTML via Angular's `DomSanitizer`), and read-only counters for views/likes/comments. Previously the click only triggered view tracking with no visible feedback. Reuses the existing `.modal-backdrop` / `.modal-panel` pattern from the comments dialog; new state signals `articleOpen`/`articleNews` and handler `closeArticle()` in `NewsHub` component.

### Changed
- **Privacy policy (DE/EN) overhauled for Garmin Connect Developer Program application.** The landing-page privacy policy templates (`frontend/public/landing/datenschutz.html`, `frontend/public/landing/en/privacy.html` and their `webpage/` duplicates) have been rewritten from a 7-section generic template into a 12-section GDPR-compliant policy that covers the full PACR application. The new structure explicitly documents: the Garmin Connect OAuth integration (data retrieved, purpose, EU storage, no-sharing commitment, disconnect flow via `Profile → Integrations → Disconnect Garmin`, and data deletion on request); other third-party integrations (Strava OAuth `activity:read_all`, COROS OAuth with webhook, OpenAI/LangChain4j with model `gpt-4o-mini`, Nominatim/OpenStreetMap, Leaflet tiles, Google Fonts, Tailwind CDN, Microsoft 365 SMTP); all data categories actually processed by PACR (account data with BCrypt-hashed passwords, training/activity data from FIT/TCX/GPX uploads, activity streams, computed metrics, community data, OAuth tokens, location data, logs, audit log); purposes and legal bases per category; EU hosting with placeholder for concrete provider; retention periods; international transfers safeguards; security measures (HTTPS, BCrypt, JWT with refresh rotation, server-side ownership checks); concrete how-to steps for users to exercise GDPR rights (account deletion via `UserDeletionService`, disconnect, subject access via info@pacr.app). Removed the amber "Final Review Note" placeholder section.
### Added
- **External running news importer: scheduled RSS/Atom feed ingestion.** A new scheduled service (`ExternalNewsImporterScheduler`, cron `0 0 9,17 * * *`) fetches configured feeds twice daily (09:00 + 17:00 server time) and imports new items as drafts into the existing News Hub. Each admin can manage feed sources at `/admin/news-sources` (new CRUD page: name, feed URL, language "de"/"en", enabled flag, manual "Fetch now" button). Imported articles are stored with the original source URL, hero image URL (referenced, not downloaded) and a stable external GUID for deduplication, land as `isPublished=false` so admins can review before publishing, and link back to the source via a "Read on {source}" CTA that opens in a new tab (`target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`). Users can multi-select the news languages they want to see under Settings; the News Hub feed is filtered by their preference (manual news with `language=null` remain visible to everyone). Backend: new entity `ExternalNewsSource`, extensions to `AppNews` (`externalGuid` UNIQUE, `externalUrl`, `externalImageUrl`, `language`, `externalSource` FK) and to `User` (`preferredNewsLanguages`). New services `RssFeedParser` (Rome library, Java `HttpClient`) and `ExternalNewsImporterService`. New admin REST endpoints under `/api/admin/news-sources` and new user endpoint `PUT /api/users/me/news-languages`. Public `GET /api/news`, `GET /api/news/featured`, `GET /api/news/trending-news` now filter by the caller's language preference. `AppNewsDto` extended with `externalUrl`, `externalImageUrl`, `sourceName`, `language`. Liquibase migrations `113-add-external-news-source.xml`, `114-extend-app-news-external.xml`, `115-add-user-news-language-prefs.xml`. New dependency `com.rometools:rome:2.1.0`. New i18n keys under `NEWS_HUB`, `ADMIN.NEWS_SOURCES_*`, `SETTINGS.NEWS_LANGUAGES_*`, and `LANGUAGE` in EN and DE.
- **News Hub: likes, inline comments and trending indicator for news posts.** Each news card now shows three counters (views, likes, comments) and a `Trending` pill overlay when the news has accumulated a configurable number of views in the last 7 days (threshold: 10). A new top-3 `Trending now` rail above the main feed surfaces the news with the highest weighted score (`views + likes*3 + comments*5` over 7 days). Clicking the heart icon toggles a like (optimistic UI with rollback), and clicking the chat icon expands an inline comment thread under the card with a compose input. Backend: new entities `AppNewsLike` and `AppNewsComment` with repositories, new endpoints `POST /api/news/{id}/like`, `GET/POST /api/news/{id}/comments`, `DELETE /api/news/comments/{commentId}` (author or admin), `GET /api/news/trending-news?limit=3`. `AppNewsDto` extended with `viewCount`, `likeCount`, `commentCount`, `hasLiked`, `isTrending`; `AppNewsCommentDto` includes a `canDelete` flag per user. Liquibase migrations `111-add-app-news-likes.xml` and `112-add-app-news-comments.xml` (unique constraint on `(news_id, user_id)` for likes). New i18n keys `NEWS_HUB.TRENDING`, `TRENDING_BADGE`, `VIEWS`, `LIKES`, `COMMENTS_LABEL`, `WRITE_COMMENT`, `POST_COMMENT_ACTION`, `NO_COMMENTS`, `COMMENTS_LOADING`, `LOGIN_TO_INTERACT` in EN and DE.

### Changed
- **News Hub social cards now render the actual route polyline** instead of a static CartoDB tile centered on the start point. Backend `FriendActivityDto` gains a nullable `previewTrack` (`double[][]`) field populated by a new helper in `FriendshipService` that loads the `ActivityStream.latlngJson`, parses it and downsamples to 60 points (same pattern as `CommunityRouteService.downsampleTrack`). Frontend `NewsHub` reuses the existing `RouteMiniMapComponent` (brand-green polyline on CartoDB tiles) as a faded card background when a track is available, and falls back to the single-tile image for activities with only a start coordinate. SCSS adds a `.map-bg--route` variant that fades the whole leaflet container (tiles + polyline) uniformly so card content stays readable.

### Added
- **News Hub**: new top-level section (sidebar entry above Dashboard, route `/news-hub`) that merges editorial announcements with friend training activity. The page has a featured hero card, a mixed feed (`News` + `Social` tabs + `All`), a right-hand sidebar with "Live Training Now" (friends whose planned training for today is not yet completed) and "Trending Topics" (aggregated from topic tags of published news in the last 30 days, sorted by view count). Backend: new public endpoints `GET /api/news`, `GET /api/news/featured`, `GET /api/news/{id}`, `POST /api/news/{id}/view` (idempotent per user), `GET /api/news/trending` (top-5 tags with headline + view/news counts), `GET /api/friendships/live-training`, and activity-level social endpoints `GET/POST /api/activities/{id}/kudos` (idempotent toggle), `GET/POST /api/activities/{id}/comments`, `DELETE /api/activities/{id}/comments/{commentId}` — all with friend-only privacy enforcement (owner OR accepted friend). New entities `ActivityKudos`, `ActivityComment`, `AppNewsView` with unique constraints preventing duplicate kudos/views; `AppNews` extended with `topicTag`, `heroImageFilename`, `isFeatured`, `excerpt`. Liquibase migrations `107`-`110`. `FriendActivityDto` extended with `activityId` so the frontend can call kudos/comments endpoints. Admin news form extended with topic tag, hero image URL, excerpt and "feature in hero" toggle. Frontend: new `PublicNewsService`, `ActivitySocialService`, `FriendshipService.getLiveTraining()`, `NewsHub` component with inline comments modal. New i18n keys `NAV.NEWS_HUB` and `NEWS_HUB.*` (EN/DE).

### Changed
- **Readiness score now considers the last 4 days of training load with time-weighted decay** (was: 1-2 days). Hard sessions from several days ago still influence today's readiness via an exponential decay window (T-1=0.80, T-2=0.55, T-3=0.30). Thresholds tuned so a hard Saturday session still lowers Tuesday's score instead of decaying to 95. Applied consistently in both `MetricsKernelService` and the legacy `ReadinessService` via a shared `ReadinessDeductionCalculator` utility. ACWR RED/ORANGE deductions adjusted to -30/-18 (base score remains 100).

### Added
- **`GET /api/daily-metrics/explain` endpoint** to diagnose the readiness score. Returns the base score, final score, recommendation, all applied deductions (with input value, threshold, source and contributing days) and all raw inputs (ACWR, daily strain for T-3..T, Z4+Z5 per day, weighted aggregates, last decoupling, sleep/HRV/body battery). Read-only — does not persist. A structured log line `metrics_kernel_readiness_deductions` is emitted on every readiness compute for production diagnosis.

### Added
- **Repeating step blocks (Nx) for trainings**: admin training editor can now group steps into repeating blocks (e.g. `5x (1000m work + 200m rest)`) instead of duplicating individual steps. New backend entity `TrainingStepBlock` with `repeatCount`, optional `label` and a nested `OneToMany` of `TrainingStep`s; `TrainingStep` gains a nullable `block` reference and `blockSortOrder`. Top-level free steps and blocks share the same `sortOrder` space, so the original order on the training is preserved. `TrainingService.findById/save/update` were extended to fetch and persist blocks together with their steps. New Liquibase migration `106-add-training-step-blocks.xml` adds the `training_step_blocks` table and the `block_id` / `block_sort_order` columns on `training_steps` (both with cascade-delete FK constraints). Frontend admin form (`/admin/trainings/:id/edit`) replaces the flat step list with a tagged-union `items` FormArray; new `[+ Block]` button creates a block with an editable `repeatCount` input, optional label and nested step list. Estimated distance, duration and calories are now computed by multiplying block contents by `repeatCount`. The user-facing training detail (`/training/:id`) renders blocks as a compact card with a green left accent border, an `Nx` badge and indented step list. New i18n keys `ADMIN.ADD_BLOCK`, `ADD_STEP_TO_BLOCK`, `REMOVE_BLOCK`, `BLOCK_REPEAT_COUNT`, `BLOCK_LABEL`, `BLOCK_LABEL_PLACEHOLDER` in EN and DE.

### Changed
- **Community routes cards now show a mini-map preview**: Each card in the `/community-routes` grid renders a small non-interactive Leaflet map of the route in the header area instead of the unused gradient placeholder. Backend `CommunityRouteDto` gains a nullable `previewTrack` (`double[][]`) field populated by a new stride-based `downsampleTrack()` helper in `CommunityRouteService` (capped at 60 points so JSON stays small). New standalone `RouteMiniMapComponent` (`frontend/src/app/components/shared/route-mini-map/`) renders the polyline in brand green `#8ffc2e` on CartoDB dark tiles, auto-fits to the route bounds, and disables all user interaction (drag/zoom/scroll). Card header height reduced from 12rem to 9rem, overlay gradient strengthened so the route name remains legible. Routes without a GPS track fall back to the original gradient placeholder.

### Added
- **Admin: rename community routes**: The `/admin/community-routes` list now supports inline editing of route names directly in the table row. Clicking the edit icon turns the name cell into a focused text input with Save/Cancel buttons; Enter saves, Escape cancels. Validation errors are shown beneath the input. New backend endpoint `PUT /api/admin/community-routes/{id}` (body `{ "name": "..." }`) via `AdminCommunityRouteController.renameRoute` and `CommunityRouteService.adminRenameRoute`, secured with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`. Works for both admin-uploaded and user-shared routes.

### Added
- **GDPR-compliant user deletion from admin area**: Admins can now permanently delete user accounts and all associated personal data (trainings, metrics, integrations, tokens, feedback, friendships, competitions, AI plans, cycle/asthma/sleep data, etc.) directly from the admin user list. Community routes created by the deleted user are preserved and have their `creator_id` set to `NULL` so they remain available to the community. A two-step confirmation dialog requires the admin to retype the target username before the `Delete permanently` button is enabled, preventing accidental deletions. Admins cannot delete their own account. New backend service `UserDeletionService` performs all deletions in a single transaction using native SQL in FK-safe order, and anonymizes the actor id on existing audit-log entries. New endpoint `DELETE /api/users/{id}` with body `{ "confirmUsername": "..." }`, secured with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`. New `AuditAction.USER_DELETED` is written after a successful deletion. Liquibase migration `099-community-routes-creator-nullable.xml` drops the `NOT NULL` constraint on `community_routes.creator_id`.
- **Bot Runner system**: admins can now create scheduled virtual runners that automatically pick a nearby community route and generate a realistic `CompletedTraining` + `ActivityStream` on a weekday/time schedule. Bots are ordinary `User` rows with a new `is_bot` flag (login is explicitly blocked in `AuthController` to prevent takeover) and a 1:1 `BotProfile` entity holding pace range, distance range, HR profile, home coordinates, search radius, weekday set, start time and jitter. `BotRunnerService.executeBot` selects a route via `CommunityRouteRepository.findInBoundingBox` filtered by the bot's distance range, copies the GPS track from the route (or its source activity stream), generates a plausible heart-rate series, saves the activity, and publishes `TrainingCompletedEvent` so the existing `RouteAttemptService` auto-matches the run into the leaderboard (opt-in per bot via `includeInLeaderboard`). `BotRunnerScheduler` ticks every minute (`@Scheduled(cron = "0 * * * * *")`) and runs all due bots. New admin REST API `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/bot-runners` and `POST /api/admin/bot-runners/{id}/run-now`, all secured with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`. New frontend admin tab under `/admin/bot-runners` (`BotRunnerList` + `BotRunnerForm`) with full i18n. Liquibase migration `098-add-bot-runners.xml` adds `users.is_bot` and the new `bot_profiles` table.
- **Admin: GPX upload for community routes**: new admin page under `/admin/community-routes` lets admins upload curated running routes from GPX files. New endpoints `GET/POST/DELETE /api/admin/community-routes` (`AdminCommunityRouteController`, secured with `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`). `CommunityRouteService.createFromGpx` reuses `GpxParsingService` and stores the parsed track points as `gps_track_json`. `ParsedActivityData` now exposes the parsed `latLngPoints` list. Liquibase migration `095-community-route-source-activity-nullable.xml` makes `community_routes.source_activity_id` nullable so admin-uploaded routes can exist without a source `CompletedTraining`. Frontend: new standalone `AdminCommunityRoutes` component with file-upload form and list/delete actions, linked from the admin shell nav.
- **Admin email notification on new user registration**: When a new user registers, all users with the `ADMIN` role now receive a plain-text email with the new user's username, email, registration timestamp, ID and status. Implemented via new `EmailService.sendAdminNewUserNotification(...)` and a new `UserRepository.findByRole(...)` query. Failures of the admin notification do not break the registration flow.
- **AI-driven adaptive training suggestion in cycle tracking view**: The "PACR Adaptive Adjustment" card in the cycle tracking view is no longer hardcoded. It now fetches today's actually planned training and asks the LLM (via `LLMClientService`) for an alternative workout adapted to the user's current cycle phase and daily wellbeing (energy, sleep, mood, symptoms). New backend endpoint `GET /api/cycle-tracking/adaptive-suggestion` (`CycleAdaptiveTrainingController` + `CycleAdaptiveTrainingService`, DTO `AdaptiveSuggestionDto`). When AI is disabled or the LLM call fails, the original planned training is still shown without an AI explanation.
- **Forgot password / password reset**: complete end-to-end flow. New endpoints `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` and `POST /api/auth/reset-password` with secure SHA-256 hashed reset tokens (32 bytes, 60 min expiry). `EmailService.sendPasswordResetEmail` sends a link to `/new-password?token=...`. Frontend `forgot-password`, `forgot-password-confirmation` and `new-password` components are now wired to the API; on successful reset all refresh tokens for the user are revoked. Liquibase migration `093-add-password-reset-token.xml` adds `password_reset_token_hash` and `password_reset_token_expires_at` columns to `users`. Forgot-password endpoint always returns 200 to prevent user enumeration.
- **Nearby friends discovery**: the Friends "Find" tab now supports searching for other discoverable users in your vicinity via a new "Nearby" mode with selectable radius (10/25/50/100 km). Users can set their location in settings either via the map picker or the browser's current position (`PUT /api/users/me/location`, `DELETE /api/users/me/location`). New endpoint `GET /api/friendships/search/nearby?lat=&lon=&radiusKm=` returns results with Haversine-calculated distances. Liquibase migration `092-add-user-location-fields.xml` adds `latitude`, `longitude`, and `location_updated_at` columns to `users`.
- **Friends / Connections** feature in the Community menu: search for other discoverable users, send/accept friend requests, view a feed of recent activities from connected users. New backend module (`Friendship` entity, `FriendshipService`, `/api/friendships` endpoints) and new Angular `Friends` component with tabs for Activity, Friends, Requests and Find. Liquibase migration `091-add-friendships.xml` creates the `friendships` table.
- Settings: merged "Community Routes" and "Group Events" into a single **Community** card
- New toggle "Discoverable by other runners" in the Community settings card, backed by a new `discoverable_by_others` flag on the user (Liquibase migration `090`)

### Fixed
- **Security: Strava integration is now user-scoped.** Previously, `StravaToken` queries used a global `findFirstByOrderByIdAsc()` lookup, so any authenticated user saw the first connected Strava account as "Verbunden", could sync that user's activities, and could disconnect it for everyone. `StravaService` now resolves tokens via `findByUser(currentUser)`, `exchangeCodeForToken` stores the `user_id` on the token, and `disconnect` only removes the current user's token. Liquibase migration `094-strava-token-user-scope.xml` deletes orphaned tokens, marks `strava_token.user_id` NOT NULL and adds a unique constraint on it.
- Verification email link no longer falls back to `localhost:4200`. `EmailService` now fails fast at startup if `app.frontend-url` is not configured, preventing broken links in production
- `app.frontend-url` is set to `https://pacr.app` in `application-prod.properties` (no env var indirection)

### Fixed
- Verify-email page no longer renders the sidebar, which previously triggered an unauthenticated `/me` request and bounced new users to the login screen
- Registration flow: login with an unverified email now automatically redirects to the verify-email screen instead of only showing an error
- Verification email now contains a direct link (`/verify-email?email=…&code=…`) that pre-fills the code and auto-submits verification
- Verify-email screen accepts `email` and `code` via query parameters as a fallback when router state is missing

### Added
- New backend property `app.frontend-url` (env `APP_FRONTEND_URL`) used to build links in outgoing emails
- `EmailService.sendVerificationEmail(to, code, resend)` centralises the verification email content
- Login error response for unverified users now includes the `email` field so the frontend can navigate

### Added
- Admin Login Messages: admins can create info messages shown as one-time dialog after user login
- New admin tab "Login Messages" with create/edit/publish/unpublish/delete functionality
- User-facing dialog shows pending messages after login with dismiss tracking per user
- New Liquibase migration 088: `login_messages` and `login_message_seen_log` tables
- New endpoints: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/login-messages`, `GET /api/login-messages/pending`, `POST /api/login-messages/{id}/dismiss`
- i18n support (en + de) for all login message labels
